<p>The Federal Reserve made the first rate cut in over fours by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. Going into the meeting there was a 67% chance of a 50 point cut, however, by this morning most banks estimated that it would only be a 25 point cut. The last rate cut decision was in the covid era, which was later followed by rate HIKES implemented to combat the rising inflation. Today's cut is representative of the Fed's growing confidence that they are sustainably moving towards the 2% inflation target, for the desired soft landing. Alongside this cut, the Fed has signaled plans for another 50 basis points reduction by the end of 2024. The market reacted positively to the news, as $SPY hit an all time high of 568.69 which was not sustained and quickly sold off, coming back down to where we closed the market yesterday. I believe that a trend day is coming up in the next two days, in either direction, and will try to take advantage of that as I react to price action rather than predicting.</p>

<p>As investors, I am still remaining cautious as there are definitely some major catalysts in the coming months, especially with elections. Some are speculating that the Fed is in a panic state, or even holding the market up before elections as these political and economic factors are affecting decisions. Although the Federal Reserve is an independent entity with no political ties, there could be some manipulation until after elections are over, making it crucial to be observant and wary.</p>

Palantir also made waves at their AIPCon, showcasing continued growth and industry disruption.",

                        <p>It is evident that we are currently in a very volatile market as investors and market makers gauge the huge fed decision next week on Wednesday, Sept. 18th. The whole week consisted of a sell off early in the day and bulls buying it back up to being green for the day. Ultimately, the S & P rose 4% on the week which was driven by high optimism from investors. The biggest days this week were Wednesday and Thursday where in the 2 day session, $SPY moved the length of an average trading week. Pivoting to certain catalysts, the biggest was Apple’s  ‘Glowtime’ event (we will discuss a bit later),  as well as Oracle’s impressive earnings. $ORCL was particularly impressive due to their strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services, allowing AWS users to access Oracle’s Database, which simplifies deployment of enterprise workload on the cloud. This was followed by their earnings call where they raised their 2026 guidance to $66 billion, topping analyst expectations by $1.5 billion.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$APPLE: Glowtime Event</h3>
                        <p>In my honest opinion, this event and the unveiling of the new iphone was highly disappointing. Apple has really stepped away from the visionary and innovative company that Steve Jobs once built. While they seem focused on improving their ecosystem, which is good, it doesn’t attract new customers and could let competitors catch up. Just recently, we saw Huawei, a Chinese company, release a new phone with a tri-fold screen, showcasing innovation that Apple seems to be lacking. To add to this, Warren Buffet, one of the greatest investors of all time, has begun unloading all of his Apple shares, which could be a signal that he has lost faith in the company’s future direction.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$PLTR: AIPCon</h3>
                        <p>On September 12th, 2024 Palantir held their AIPCon with over 100+ organizations in attendance. This event allows for featured organizations to showcase and demo their use of Palantir’s technology in front of others. Since the start of this convention in 2023, it was really the tipping point that allowed Palantir to pivot from just a government defense company to expanding into the commercial sector. AIPCon highlighted Palantir's continued growth, with disruptions in industries such as healthcare and finance with the use of their technology. One of the most interesting presentations in my opinion was Palantir allowing the business, Associated Materials, to use and deploy their ERP system with more capabilities and less time. For example, an organization that would develop an ERP system across 11 factories would take 5+ years, and Palantir could do that in 9 months.That signaled that ERP system resellers will soon be gone and their clients will look elsewhere.</p>

                    <p>Today's trading session was marked by high volatility as the market digested critical economic data, including the non-farm payroll numbers ahead of the much-anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 18th-19th. The data revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, falling short of the expected 161,000. This weaker-than-expected job growth heightened fears of an economic slowdown, prompting speculation about potential interest rate cuts ranging from 25 to 75 basis points.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$SPY: Market Under Pressure</h3>
                    <p>The SPDR S&P 500 ETF ($SPY), a benchmark for the overall market, started the day with an initial pop at 5:30 AM PST, reflecting early optimism. However, this quickly faded as the market opened, leading to a sharp sell-off. By the end of the trading day, $SPY had dropped $9.25, closing significantly lower as investor concerns about economic growth and the Fed decision took center stage. I believe that we will continue to have a volatile market till the decision comes out. Septemeber truly is bear season.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$GME: GameStop's Pop Upon Kitty Tweet</h3>
                    <p>GameStop ($GME), the OG meme stock, defied the broader market trend with a rally. Despite the general downturn in the market, $GME managed to post gains, as investors speculated that Roaring Kitty might be back from his hiding. This rally comes ahead of the company's quarterly earnings release on September 10th, 2024, with an estimated move of (+/-) 23.59%. The company's substantial cash reserves and potential shift from meme stock status to a more traditional investment under the leadership of Ryan Cohen have fueled this. With the upcoming earnings report, all eyes will be on $GME to see if it can continue its upward momentum.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$PLTR: Huge day for Palantir and Alex Karp</h3>
                    <p>Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), one of my favorite companies, had an eventful day. Having been an investor since 2021, I've watched the company grow, fall, and grow again, establishing themselves as a leader in artificial intelligence with real, tangible use cases for major corporations. Today, $PLTR achieved a significant milestone: approval for inclusion in the S&P 500. This long-awaited recognition followed five straight quarters of GAAP profitability and increasing institutional ownership. The announcement led to a after-market pop in $PLTR's stock price. We will see if that pop is sustained or will it cause institutional selloff similar to what we seen with $SMCI.</p>
