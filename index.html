                        <p> As someone that is a total beginner to coding, diving into web development was both exciting and challenging. One of the biggest hurdles that I encountered was navigating the complexities of coding, especially in the beginning stages of setting up my environment. To help me with my development, I utilized Cursor as my IDE, which integrates an AI assistant to aid in any processes and actually teach me on why every single line of code is being implemented. Learning to use such a powerful application like Cursor is a game-changer. Not only does it break down the barriers of entry into coding for a beginners but it also allows for rapid development of websites, applications, and new software. The usability and efficiency of Cursor enabled me to overcome any hurdles, making it a revolutionary tool in the developer space. Although sometimes the application would hallucinate and not be helpful at times, I learned to be determined and effectively communicate on what I want the website to do. I am really looking frward to utilizing this technology more and ultimately bringing some of my ideas into fruition. This experience truly taught me how rapid technology is moving and how it is disrupting and creating different industries with a simple, but innovative tool.</p>

                         <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Future Improvements:</h3>
                        <p>While my website is functional and servesw its purpose, I understand there can be many improvements in the future, and it is far from perfect. One of my first thigns I would be is to use a backend database, such as a content management system, to ease the process of adding blog posts. Currently, I have to hardcode any new content directly into the site, which, while functional, is not the most efficient. Another significant area for improvement is the User Interface and overall design. The site currently has a dark and bland aesthetic, and I plan to enhance it by incorporating animations, experimenting with different color themes, and refining the fonts to make it more appealing. Additionally, I am working on improving the Mobile interface, as some sections, like the header tabs, are cut off when accessed on a phone. While these may seem like simple improvements, they can have a drastic impact on the user experience. The advantage of coding the site myself, rather than using a site generator, is that it allows for ongoing customization and improvements. As I continue to develop my skills in web development, I am confident that my design and UI principles will evolve and gradually improve over time. </p>

                          <p class="mb-4">In today's highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer retention is more important than ever. Companies are increasingly challenged to maintain their customer base while simultaneously attracting new ones. Despite the efforts of companies, customer churn – where customers leave a provider for another – remains a significant issue that must be addressed. This loss in customers not only affects the immediate revenue of the company, but it also increases the cost of customer acquisition, as different departments must allocate additional resources to replace these lost customers.</p>

                          <p class="mb-4">Customer churn particularly affects industries like telecommunications the most, as customers don't have options for numerous service offerings, which lead them to be highly sensitive to pricing, quality, and support. Retaining existing customers is much more cost-effective than acquiring a new one, making churn reduction a top priority and an important factor in the success of the business. However, many companies across a variety of industries struggle to identify the key factors that drive customers to leave, which is essential for developing effective retention strategies.</p>

                          <p class="mb-4">To address this challenge, Teleco will look into their internal data to predict and manage customer churn. By analyzing this dataset which includes customer demographics, service usage patterns, and billing information, Telco can identify trends and patterns that will represent a  higher likelihood of churn. These insights will better inform our key stakeholders in their decision making to explore different strategies such as, offering targeted promotions or improving service quality, to retain customers who are at risk of leaving.</p>

                        <p>Reflecting back, there would be several improvements for future analysis. I would first explore more advanced predictive models such as Random Forests or even a more advanced k-means clustering method, which could produce more accurate and tailored churn predictions. As far as visualizations, I would develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI that would allow stakeholders to explore the data and insights in a more dynamic matter. Lastly, a huge part of being an analyst is being a good storyteller and effectively engaging stakeholders with insights found within the data. As these stakeholders often get bored or don't understand such things like data, having appealing and easy to read visualizations (Such as the last example in the image provided above) will help keep their attention and make sure key insights are effectively communicated. By improving my skills in these areas, I hope to create more meaningful and insightful analysis.</p>

                           <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    
    <p>Mutual funds and ETFs are popular investments for individuals that are looking to grow their wealth over time in a safe manner. However, there are many different funds and ETFs that individuals can choose from that each have their specific benefits. Historically, the average annual return for the stock market is around 10%, making these funds an attractive and safe option for long-term investors. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, famously said, "<em>The stock market is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient.</em>" This is representative of the importance of <strong>time in the market</strong>, which means that consistent investing over time will often outperform short term trading. This creates an issue of choosing the right type of fund and ETF that is personalized to your goals and needs, making it essential to understand one's holdings, performance, and risk profile.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Purpose of the Analysis</strong></h2>
    
    <p>The purpose of this analysis is to use the ETF dataset to provide practical insights that can guide both individual and institutional investors in making data-driven decisions. As investing gains more popularity, ETFs are a wise choice for beginners as they are well diversified in their holdings as well as cost-effective. When choosing the right fund or ETF it is critical to understand how various factors such as performance, volatility, risk, and expenses can impact returns over time.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identify and Evaluate Performance Trends:</strong> Understand how an ETF performs over time and whether the trend is consistently growing, stagnating, or declining can help investors make decisions on whether to buy, hold, or sell. These historical trends show whether an ETF has long-term growth potential or if it's struggling.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze Volatility:</strong> Volatility is associated with risk within an ETF. By knowing the price fluctuations, investors can determine whether it fits their risk tolerance. Highly volatile ETFs may offer better returns but that will come with increased risk. Stable ETFs may offer minimized growth, however it will be much safer. This is key in determining long-term projection and risk tolerance.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk-Reward Trade off:</strong> Risk to Reward or R:R ratio is critical in selecting a fund that is personalized to your goals and needs. For example, younger investors might seek higher-risk, higher-return ETFs for growth, while retirees may prefer lower-risk, stable-return funds.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2><strong>About the Dataset</strong></h2>
    
    <p>This dataset was found on Kaggle and is titled, "US Funds dataset from Yahoo Finance" by Stefano Leone. This set was scraped from Yahoo Finance, which is a public website.

                        <p>Today's trading session was marked by high volatility as the market digested critical economic data, including the non-farm payroll numbers ahead of the much-anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on September 18th-19th. The data revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, falling short of the expected 161,000. This weaker-than-expected job growth heightened fears of an economic slowdown, prompting speculation about potential interest rate cuts ranging from 25 to 75 basis points.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$SPY: Market Under Pressure</h3>
                        <p>The SPDR S&P 500 ETF ($SPY), a benchmark for the overall market, started the day with an initial pop at 5:30 AM PST, reflecting early optimism. However, this quickly faded as the market opened, leading to a sharp sell-off. By the end of the trading day, $SPY had dropped $9.25, closing significantly lower as investor concerns about economic growth and the Fed decision took center stage. I believe that we will continue to have a volatile market till the decision comes out. Septemeber truly is bear season.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$GME: GameStop's Pop Upon Kitty Tweet</h3>
                        <p>GameStop ($GME), the OG meme stock, defied the broader market trend with a rally. Despite the general downturn in the market, $GME managed to post gains, as investors speculated that Roaring Kitty might be back from his hiding. This rally comes ahead of the company's quarterly earnings release on September 10th, 2024, with an estimated move of (+/-) 23.59%. The company's substantial cash reserves and potential shift from meme stock status to a more traditional investment under the leadership of Ryan Cohen have fueled this. With the upcoming earnings report, all eyes will be on $GME to see if it can continue its upward momentum.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$PLTR: Huge day day for Palantir and Alex Karp</h3>
                        <p>Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), one of my favorite companies, had an eventful day. Having been an investor since 2021, I've watched the company grow, fall, and grow again, establishing themselves as a leader in artificial intelligence with real, tangible use cases for major corporations. Today, $PLTR achieved a significant milestone: approval for inclusion in the S&P 500. This long-awaited recognition followed five straight quarters of GAAP profitability and increasing institutional ownership. The announcement led to a after-market pop in $PLTR's stock price. We will see if that pop is sustained or will it cause institutional selloff similar to what we seen with $SMCI.</p>

                        <p>It is evident that we are currently in a very volatile market as investors and market makers gauge the huge fed decision next week on Wednesday, Sept. 18th. The whole week consisted of a sell off early in the day and bulls buying it back up to being green for the day. Ultimately, the S & P rose 4% on the week which was driven by high optimism from investors. The biggest days this week were Wednesday and Thursday where in the 2 day session, $SPY moved the length of an average trading week. Pivoting to certain catalysts, the biggest was Apple’s  ‘Glowtime’ event (we will discuss a bit later),  as well as Oracle’s impressive earnings. $ORCL was particularly impressive due to their strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services, allowing AWS users to access Oracle’s Database, which simplifies deployment of enterprise workload on the cloud. This was followed by their earnings call where they raised their 2026 guidance to $66 billion, topping analyst expectations by $1.5 billion.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$APPLE: Glowtime Event</h3>
                        <p>In my honest opinion, this event and the unveiling of the new iphone was highly disappointing. Apple has really stepped away from the visionary and innovative company that Steve Jobs once built. While they seem focused on improving their ecosystem, which is good, it doesn’t attract new customers and could let competitors catch up. Just recently, we saw Huawei, a Chinese company, release a new phone with a tri-fold screen, showcasing innovation that Apple seems to be lacking. To add to this, Warren Buffet, one of the greatest investors of all time, has begun unloading all of his Apple shares, which could be a signal that he has lost faith in the company’s future direction.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">$PLTR: AIPCon</h3>
                        <p>On September 12th, 2024 Palantir held their AIPCon with over 100+ organizations in attendance. This event allows for featured organizations to showcase and demo their use of Palantir’s technology in front of others. Since the start of this convention in 2023, it was really the tipping point that allowed Palantir to pivot from just a government defense company to expanding into the commercial sector. AIPCon highlighted Palantir's continued growth, with disruptions in industries such as healthcare and finance with the use of their technology. One of the most interesting presentations in my opinion was Palantir allowing the business, Associated Materials, to use and deploy their ERP system with more capabilities and less time. For example, an organization that would develop an ERP system across 11 factories would take 5+ years, and Palantir could do that in 9 months.That signaled that ERP system resellers will soon be gone and their clients will look elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve made the first rate cut in over fours by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points. Going into the meeting there was a 67% chance of a 50 point cut, however, by this morning most banks estimated that it would only be a 25 point cut. The last rate cut decision was in the covid era, which was later followed by rate HIKES implemented to combat the rising inflation. Today's cut is representative of the Fed's growing confidence that they are sustainably moving towards the 2% inflation target, for the desired soft landing. Alongside this cut, the Fed has signaled plans for another 50 basis points reduction by the end of 2024. The market reacted positively to the news, as $SPY hit an all time high of 568.69 which was not sustained and quickly sold off, coming back down to where we closed the market yesterday. I believe that a trend day is coming up in the next two days, in either direction, and will try to take advantage of that as I react to price action rather than predicting.</p>

<p>As investors, I am still remaining cautious as there are definitely some major catalysts in the coming months, especially with elections. Some are speculating that the Fed is in a panic state, or even holding the market up before elections as these political and economic factors are affecting decisions. Although the Federal Reserve is an independent entity with no political ties, there could be some manipulation until after elections are over, making it crucial to be observant and wary.</p>
