Overall, I am pretty happy with how it turned out especially with the formatting and the different functionalities, considering that I am new to coding. However, there could be major improvements to be made in the future and I will continue to learn and develop my skills to adress any shortcomings. In this project, here are some of the key accomplishments: :</p>

                                      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Biggest Challenges:</h3>

                                    <p> As someone that is a total beginner to coding, diving into web development was both exciting and challenging. One of the biggest hurdles that I encountered was navigating the complexities of coding, especially in the beginning stages of setting up my environment. To help me with my development, I utilized Cursor as my IDE, which integrates an AI assistant to aid in any processes and actually teach me on why every single line of code is being implemented. Learning to use such a powerful application like Cursor is a game-changer. Not only does it break down the barriers of entry into coding for a beginners but it also allows for rapid development of websites, applications, and new software. The usability and efficiency of Cursor enabled me to overcome any hurdles, making it a revolutionary tool in the developer space. Although sometimes the application would hallucinate and not be helpful at times, I learned to be determined and effectively communicate on what I want the website to do. I am really looking frward to utilizing this technology more and ultimately bringing some of my ideas into fruition. This experience truly taught me how rapid technology is moving and how it is disrupting and creating different industries with a simple, but innovative tool.</p>

                                     <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Future Improvements:</h3>
                                    <p>While my website is functional and servesw its purpose, I understand there can be many improvements in the future, and it is far from perfect. One of my first thigns I would be is to use a backend database, such as a content management system, to ease the process of adding blog posts. Currently, I have to hardcode any new content directly into the site, which, while functional, is not the most efficient. Another significant area for improvement is the User Interface and overall design. The site currently has a dark and bland aesthetic, and I plan to enhance it by incorporating animations, experimenting with different color themes, and refining the fonts to make it more appealing. Additionally, I am working on improving the Mobile interface, as some sections, like the header tabs, are cut off when accessed on a phone. While these may seem like simple improvements, they can have a drastic impact on the user experience. The advantage of coding the site myself, rather than using a site generator, is that it allows for ongoing customization and improvements. As I continue to develop my skills in web development, I am confident that my design and UI principles will evolve and gradually improve over time. </p>

                summary: "In this data analysis project, I analyzed internal customer data to identify key factors influencing churn at a telecommunications company. Using Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, I identified key variables driving churn and developed strategies to improve customer retention.",
                details: `
                      <p class="mb-4">In today's highly competitive telecommunications industry, customer retention is more important than ever. Companies are increasingly challenged to maintain their customer base while simultaneously attracting new ones. Despite the efforts of companies, customer churn – where customers leave a provider for another – remains a significant issue that must be addressed. This loss in customers not only affects the immediate revenue of the company, but it also increases the cost of customer acquisition, as different departments must allocate additional resources to replace these lost customers.</p>

                      <p class="mb-4">Customer churn particularly affects industries like telecommunications the most, as customers don't have options for numerous service offerings, which lead them to be highly sensitive to pricing, quality, and support. Retaining existing customers is much more cost-effective than acquiring a new one, making churn reduction a top priority and an important factor in the success of the business. However, many companies across a variety of industries struggle to identify the key factors that drive customers to leave, which is essential for developing effective retention strategies.</p>

                      <p class="mb-4">To address this challenge, Teleco will look into their internal data to predict and manage customer churn. By analyzing this dataset which includes customer demographics, service usage patterns, and billing information, Telco can identify trends and patterns that will represent a  higher likelihood of churn. These insights will better inform our key stakeholders in their decision making to explore different strategies such as, offering targeted promotions or improving service quality, to retain customers who are at risk of leaving.</p>

                    <p>Reflecting back, there would be several improvements for future analysis. I would first explore more advanced predictive models such as Random Forests or even a more advanced k-means clustering method, which could produce more accurate and tailored churn predictions. As far as visualizations, I would develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI that would allow stakeholders to explore the data and insights in a more dynamic matter. Lastly, a huge part of being an analyst is being a good storyteller and effectively engaging stakeholders with insights found within the data. As these stakeholders often get bored or don't understand such things like data, having appealing and easy to read visualizations (Such as the last example image provided above) will help keep their attention and make sure key insights are effectively communicated. By improving my skills in these areas, I hope to create more meaningful and insightful analysis.</p>

                        <p>Mutual funds and ETFs are popular investments for individuals that are looking to grow their wealth over time in a safe manner. However, there are many different funds and ETFs that individuals can choose from that each have their specific benefits. Historically, the average annual return for the stock market is around 10%, making these funds an attractive and safe option for long-term investors. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, famously said, "The stock market is designed to transfer money from the Active to the Patient." This is representative of the importance of <strong>time in the market</strong>, which means that consistent investing over time will often outpreform short term trading. This creates an issue of choosing the right type of fund and ETF that is personalized to your goals and needs, making it essential to understand ones holdings, performance, and risk profile.</p>

                      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                          <li><strong>Identify and Evaluate Performance Trends:</strong> Understand how an ETF performs over time and whether the trend is consistently growing, stagnating, or declining can helps investors make decisions on to buy, hold, or sell. These Historical trends show whether an ETF has long-term growth potential or if it’s struggling.<br></li>
                          <li><strong>Analyze Volatility:</strong> Volatility is associated with risk withen an ETF. By knowing the price fluctuations, investors can determine whether it fits their risk tolerance. Highly volatile ETFs may offer better returns but that will come with increased risk. Stable ETFs may offer minimized growth, hower it will be much safer. This is key in determining long-term projection and risk tolerance.<br></li>
                          <li><strong>Risk-Reward Trade Off:</strong> Risk to Reward or R:R ratio is critical in selecting a fund that is personalized to your goals and needs. For example, younger investors might seek higher-risk, higher-return ETFs for growth, while retirees may prefer lower-risk, stable-return funds.</li>

                      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">About the Dataset</h3>
                      <p>This dataset was found on Kaggle and is titled, "US Funds dataset from Yahoo Finance" by Stefano Leone. This set was scraped from Yahoo Finance, which is a public website. It contains 7 different datasets that are related to ETFs and Mutual Funds. Let's dive in to each dataset and I will give a brief description of each one.</p>
                        <div class="my-8"></div>

                      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Future Improvements</h3>
                       <p class="mb-4">There would be many different processes for analysis that would make the project more effective and the analysis that actually draw valuable insights. Looking at the results, I am definetly not satisfied and will improve in the future. Lets discuss some of them. First I feel like the purpose of the analysis was sufficient and it gave me a clear direction on what insights to pursue withen the dataset. The first batch of improvements I would make was the process of data cleaning, that would have significantly made my analysis easier as the project went on. During the process, I was dealing with 7 different datasets that contained an excess amount of missing values. The missing values were important variables such as 3-10 year performance, fund expenses, sharpe ratio, etc... These were valuable information that would have contributed later onto the analysis especially in the composite scores and the risk-reward tradeoff as expenses and commissions are a major part of investing. For these variables, I dropped the columsn that had an excess that was missing with a tolerance of 100. In the future, I would raise up the tolerance up more to have more flexibility, but even better, I would find the mean or median of that column and fund and insert values instead of dropping them.</p>

                          <p class="mb-4">Probably the biggest mistake that I made, but also easy to implement is sorting the output of the queries in a way that made sense to what I was searching for. For example, in the second basic query that I did (Calculating the daily price range, which is volatility for each ETF), I would have the query display the ETFs with the highest volatility as well as the lowest volatility ones. In my querys I only displayed the head or the tail of the dataset that was sorted by the fund's name in alphabetical order. This definetly made the analysis not effective at all since the displayed ETFs or mutual funds were constrained and didn't take into account the best or worst performers of the query. This would have made significant changes in the output and anlysis as we would have seen a holistic view of the best and worst funds.</p>

                          <p class="mb-4">As breifly discussed earlier, I ran into some troubles with missing values when calculating the composite score. These missing values skewed the composite score a bit and made the score actually not reliable. In the future, I would focus on handling these missing values more effectively. For example, instead of excluding the funds with missing data, I would fill in these values using statistical methods with the mean or median of similar funds within the same category. Additionally, I would include important variables like expense ratios, Sharpe ratios, and long-term performance data withen the composite score that would make a much more accurate depiction of each fund's risk-adjusted returns.</p>

                          <p class="mb-4">In addition to improving on my basic queries, I would also make some more advanced queries that would provide deeper insights into the analysis. For example, some things I could have done were time-specific queries such as looking for specific analysis withen a time frame to see which funds perform the best or the worst in market conditions such as recessions, bull markets, stagnated markets, or even sector specific booms.</p>
